# Why nit h1 and h2










## Question

I like that head is without level so that the Compiler can chose the level automatically.

But maybe h1 is still better than declaring the level with a parameter which is quite cumbersome to type and might waste tokens in AI context.

You raise a critical point about token efficiency and typing speed. In the context of AI generation and "messy" HTML, `<h1>`–`<h6>` are indeed very token-efficient, but they are **structurally brittle**.

If you move a block of code containing an `<h3>` into a different container (like a sidebar), the hierarchy often breaks. The "State of the Art" solution is indeed **Context-Sensitive Headings**, where the nesting depth determines the level automatically.

Here is the optimal solution that balances **Typing/Token Speed** with **Automatic Leveling**:

### The Optimal Solution: `head` with Implicit Parameters

We do not use `h1`, `h2`, `h3` tags. We use a single `head` marker.
However, to solve your concern about cumbersome typing (`head level="1"`), we use **Vlpt's Implicit Parameter** feature.

| Marker | Usage | Behavior | Why it is Optimal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`head`** | `head`<br>`  Title `<br>`/` | **Automatic Level**. <br>Calculates level based on nesting depth (H1 -\> H2 -\> H3). | **Refactor-proof.** You can move this block anywhere, and it stays semantically correct. |
| **`head`** | `head 1`<br>`  Title `<br>`/` | **Explicit Level**. <br>Forces H1. | **Token Efficient.** `head 1` is only 2 chars more than `h1` but keeps the language consistent. |

### Why `head` is superior to `h1`–`h6` for AI

1.  **Eliminates "Level Hallucination":** AI often struggles to keep track of current heading depth in long documents. It might randomly jump from `h2` to `h4`. With `head`, the AI simply declares "This is a header," and the Compiler guarantees a perfect, mathematically correct hierarchy (1, 1.1, 1.1.1).
2.  **Component Reusability:** If you define a "User Card" component using `h3`, you can never use it on a page where the main title is `h4` (the hierarchy would be inverted). With `head`, the card adapts to its parent container automatically.
