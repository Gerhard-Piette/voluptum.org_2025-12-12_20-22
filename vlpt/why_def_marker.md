# Why def marker

## 2025 12 13 - 21 00

Because:
- I prefer 2 markers (let and def) to 1 marker with more complex syntax. Current AI works with probability and the marker should indicate what to expect.
- The "definition" term suits a longer explanation.
- The "definition" term suits Vlpt text instead of text in a limited programming language.
